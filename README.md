# Dog_City_Project_4

## What it is 
Dog City is an assistant app for dog walkers. It stores profile information for dogs and their owners and each dog profile and owner profile can be displayed individually. Dog profiles include photos, special instructions and personality profiles along with links to owner bios. Owner profiles include pertinent contact information along with a list of their dogs that link to dog profiles. Walks can be scheduled on a page that utilizes a calendar interface and checkboxes for adding and removing dogs from individual walks. Because this app will generally be used on the go, I designed it to be responsive for mobile phones.

## Why I built it
Having worked part-time as a dog walker in the past,I found the app used by the company to be hard to navigate and access. Also, there was no way to customize a walk schedule for a given day. 

## Tech used
Python
Django
PostgreSQL
CSS

## Installation
Dog City is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed via this link: [Dog City](https://dogcity.herokuapp.com/)

## Future concerns
I am going to modify this app into what I had planned for it to be originally: a way for owners to connect for playdates with their dogs. Added features will ideally include maps and messaging.
